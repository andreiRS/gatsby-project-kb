# Digital Garden

Digital gardens represent a collection of your thoughts and knowledge on various topics. Some notes might be as small as one paragraph, others as big as a complete guide on a subject.

Every idea that resonates with you is a seed planted in your digital garden. As time passes, these ideas start to grow, to expand and reach a so-called "evergreen" state.

Digital gardens differ from traditional blogs in that posts are not ordered chronologically, but instead resemble a network of ideas linked together.

You can get started nowadays with a plethora of options. If you want solutions out of the box, you can use Obsidian, Notion, and TiddlyWiki.

If you want to get your hands on a bit of coding, tools like Gatsby or Jekyll make it quite easy to have something running in less than 25 minutes. 

Maggie's Blog has examples of digital gardens as well as a comprehensive list of tools to get you started:
