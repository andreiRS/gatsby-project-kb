For 400 million years sharks and other fish have  been living in our oceans. Us Humans have been  

around for just about 300,000 years. Plastic came along only very recently,  

but if we were to continue to pollute  the oceans at the current pace,  

it will take less than 30 years before there  is more plastic in the waters as there is fish.

To put this into perspective: Imagine sharks have been on this  

planet for one whole year. Just within  the last 15 seconds before midnight  

on December 31st, we would've managed  to pollute their natural habitat.

To sharks this is a tragedy  — a tragedy of the commons.

The tragedy of the commons is a situation in which  individuals acting in their own self-interest  

behave contrary to the common  good of all others by depleting  

or spoiling the shared resource  through their collective action.  

The theory originated in an essay written in 1833  by the British economist William Forster Lloyd.

Lloyd argued that if a herder led a large herd  of cattle onto a plot of common land to graze,  

also known as commons, overgrazing could happen.

For each additional cow, the  owner of that cow could receive  

additional benefits, while all other  herders share the resulting damage.

There are three possible solutions  that could help with this.

Social norms and a common understanding of what's  right and what's wrong is probably our best bet.  

The Swiss Alps region for example has been run  by a collective of farmers for hundreds of years.  

As it is in the interest of all the farmers to  keep the commons functioning, complex social  

norms emerged, and over time became traditions.  But when people don’t share the same values,  

or new people arrive, such social contracts  often fall apart and other solutions can help.

Privatization. Turning common property into a  private one can give the owner an incentive to  

ensure its sustainability. If that happens  it’s important that the party who now owns  

that common — or rights of access — pays the  full price for its exploitation. Privatization  

works well for things that can be fenced off,  such as land, but less so for water or air. 

If someone creates negative externalities  on private land but doesn’t pay the full  

price of such externality, we need  to turn to the third solution.

State Regulation, such as farming permits,  can limit the amount of commons available to  

everyone and thereby protect them. Fishing  quotas can ensure that those that take,  

also pay the bill. Taxes can create financial  incentives by increasing the costs for creating  

negative externalities, such as polluting the air.  Regulation can make exploitation not only more  

costly, tax incomes can also be used to invest  in initiatives that help reverse the damage done.

For complex problems, such  as the plastic in our oceans,  

we probably need a combination of all three.

We can help create awareness, so we  all feel morally obliged to reduce  

our personal use of non recyclable plastics. We could ask large producers of single use  

plastics to take full responsibility  for the mess their products create  

by dedicating resources to help clean up. Countries could commit to local and international  

agreements that regulate the production of  single use plastic and other pollutants.

The grazing rules which were established in  Switzerland in 1517 are still enforced today.  

They state that "no one is permitted to send more  cows to the Alps than he can feed in winter".  

Applying the same rules to plastics, would  mean no state ought to produce more plastic  

than they can recycle within the confines  of their own borders. What do you think,  

would a similar solution work for the oceans?  And if not, what else can we do to protect the  

commons from the tragedy that's unfolding?  Share your thoughts in the comments below!
