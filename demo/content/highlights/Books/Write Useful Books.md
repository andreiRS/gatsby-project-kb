## Highlights
- As such, I invest practically 100% of my effort into creating the most useful book possible — testing it with real readers at every step — and treat marketing as largely an afterthought. Not because marketing isn’t important, but because marketing a useful book is the easiest thing in the world. ([Location 78](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0983HFQX7&location=78))
    - Note: Marketing becomes easier with more value the book provides
