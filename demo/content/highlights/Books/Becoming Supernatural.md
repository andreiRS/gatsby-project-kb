## Highlights
- we are confined in our lives only by the limits of our own beliefs. ([Location 126](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=126))
- We know that it takes a clear intention (a coherent brain) and an elevated emotion (a coherent heart) to begin to change a person’s biology from living in the past to living in the future. That combination of mind and body—of thoughts and feelings—also seems to influence matter. And that’s how you create reality. ([Location 221](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=221))
- That’s what feedback does; it helps us know when we are doing something correctly and when we aren’t. When we can change some feeling or thought inside of us, we can see changes outside of us, and when we observe that we did it correctly, we will pay attention to what we did and do it again. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=231))
- autonomic nervous system (ANS)—the system that maintains health and balance by automatically taking care of all our bodily functions ([Location 234](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=234))
- We’ve also taught our students that when they create heart coherence, their hearts create a measurable magnetic field that projects beyond their body. That magnetic field is an energy, and that energy is a frequency, and all frequency carries information. The information carried on that frequency can be an intention or thought that can influence the heart of another person at a different location by moving it into coherence and balance. ([Location 238](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=238))
- My wish is to show you the science of how you can contribute to changing the world. ([Location 249](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=249))
- everything in our material universe is always emitting light and information—including you. When you are living in survival mode under the burden of the hormones of stress (such as adrenaline), you draw from this invisible field of energy and turn it into chemistry—and as you do so, the field around your body shrinks. We discovered a very advanced piece of equipment that can measure the emission of photons (particles of light) to determine whether a person is building a field of light around them or diminishing their own light field. ([Location 255](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=255))
- When more light is emitted, there’s more energy—and hence more life. When a person has less light and information surrounding their body, they are more matter and thus emit less vital energy. ([Location 259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=259))
- Other centers in your body besides the heart are also under the control of the autonomic nervous system—I call them energy centers. ([Location 265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=265))
- moving from beta brain waves (where the thinking brain is constantly analyzing and putting much attention on the outer world) to alpha brain waves (which indicate you’re calmly placing more attention on the inner world) is key. ([Location 268](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=268))
- no matter how bad things can get, you have the power to change them— ([Location 294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=294))
- There’s a future you—a you who already exists in the eternal present moment—who is actually calling himself or herself to the more familiar you who is reading this book. And that future you is more loving, more evolved, more conscious, more present, more kind, more exuberant, more mindful, more willful, more connected, more supernatural, and more whole. That is who’s waiting for you to change your energy to match his or her energy on a daily basis so you can find that future you—who actually exists in the eternal now. ([Location 304](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=304))
- there is an invisible field of energy and information that exists beyond this three-dimensional realm of space and time—and that we have access to it. ([Location 323](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=323))
- www.becomingsupernatural.com/meditation-information. ([Location 339](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=339))
- It’s best to use music that stops you from thinking and that doesn’t evoke past memories. ([Location 341](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=341))
- The brain thinks, but the heart knows. This is the center of oneness, wholeness, and unity consciousness. It is where opposites meet, representing the union of polarities. Think of this center as your connection to the unified field. When it is activated, you go from selfish states to selfless states. When you can maintain internal states independent of conditions in your external environment, you are mastering your environment. It takes practice to get good at keeping your heart open, and if you do, it will keep beating longer. ([Location 367](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=367))
- Emotions are the chemical consequences (or feedback) of past experiences. ([Location 466](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=466))
- our thoughts and feelings affect our bodies and our lives. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=568))
- stress chemicals can create disease. ([Location 568](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=568))
- She often tells me that she loves her present life, and I always respond, “Of course you do, you created your life every day by not getting up from your meditations until you were in love with that life. So now, you get to love your life.” ([Location 682](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=682))
- from a neuroscientific understanding, ([Location 900](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=900))
- mind is the brain in action. ([Location 901](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=901))
- if learning means making new connections in your brain, memories are when you maintain those connections. ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=917))
- When you think a thought (or have a memory), a biochemical reaction begins in your brain causing the brain to release certain chemical signals. ([Location 927](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=927))
- If thoughts are the vocabulary of the brain and feelings are the vocabulary of the body, and the cycle of how you think and feel becomes your state of being, then your entire state of being is in the past. ([Location 933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=933))
- Think of emotions as energy in motion. When someone experiencing a strong emotion walks into a room, their energy (aside from their body language) is often very palpable. ([Location 1003](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1003))
- So if we are re-creating the past day after day, thinking the same thoughts and feeling the same emotions, we are broadcasting the same electromagnetic field over and over again—sending out the same energy with the same message. From the perspective of energy and information, this means the same energy of our past continues to carry the same information, which then keeps creating the same future. Our energy, then, is essentially equal to our past. The only way we can change our lives is to change our energy—to change the electromagnetic field we are constantly broadcasting. In other words, to change our state of being, we have to change how we think and how we feel. ([Location 1012](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1012))
- What you put your attention on and mentally rehearse over and over again not only becomes who you are from a biological perspective, it also determines your future. ([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1048))
- But we now know through the science of epigenetics that it’s not the gene that creates disease but the environment that programs our genes to create disease—and not just the external environment outside our body (cigarette smoke or pesticides, for example), but also the internal environment within our body: the environment outside our cells. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1101))
- emotions are chemical feedback, the end products of experiences we have in our external environment. So as we react to a situation in our external environment that produces an emotion, the resulting internal chemistry can signal our genes to either turn on (up-regulating, or producing an increased expression of the gene) or to turn off (down-regulating, or producing a decreased expression of the gene). The gene itself doesn’t physically change—the expression of the gene changes, and that expression is what matters most because that is what affects our health and our lives. Thus, even though someone may have a genetic predisposition for a particular disease, for example, if their genes continue to express health instead of expressing that disease, they won’t develop the condition and will remain healthy. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1104))
- Every one of our cells (except red blood cells) makes proteins, which are responsible for the body’s physical structure and physiological function. ([Location 1111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1111))
- muscle cells make specific proteins known as actin and myosin, and skin cells make the proteins collagen and elastin. Immune cells make antibodies, thyroid cells make thyroxine, and bone-marrow cells make hemoglobin. ([Location 1112](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1112))
- There isn’t an organ or a system in the body that does not rely on or produce proteins. ([Location 1114](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1114))
- They are a vital part of our immune system, digestion, cellular repair, and bone and muscle structure—you name it, they’re a part of it. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1115))
- the expression of proteins is the expression of life and is equal to the health of the body. ([Location 1116](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1116))
- In order for a cell to make a protein, a gene must be expressed. That’s the job of the genes, to facilitate making proteins. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1117))
- When the signal from the environment outside of the cell reaches the cell membrane, the chemical is accepted by a receptor outside of the cell and makes its way to the DNA inside the cell. Then a gene makes a new protein that’s equal to that signal. So if the information coming from outside of the cell does not change, the gene keeps making the same protein and the body stays the same. Over time, the gene will begin to down-regulate; it will either shut off its healthy expression of proteins or it will eventually wear out, like making a copy of a copy of a copy, causing the body to express a different quality of proteins. ([Location 1117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1117))
- when you change your emotions, you can change the expression of your genes (turning some on and others off) because you are sending a new chemical signal to your DNA, which can then instruct your genes to make different proteins— ([Location 1128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1128))
- up-regulating or down-regulating to make all kinds of new building blocks that can change the structure and function of your body. For example, if your immune system has been subject to living in the emotions of stress for too long and has certain genes activated for inflammation and disease, you can turn on new genes for growth and repair and switch off the old genes responsible for disease. ([Location 1130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1130))
- you have to think greater than the way you feel to make any real, lasting changes. ([Location 1153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1153))
- immunoglobulin A (IgA), a protein marker for the strength of the immune system. ([Location 1156](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1156))
- Something as simple as moving into an elevated state of joy, love, inspiration, or gratitude for five to ten minutes a day can produce significant epigenetic changes in your health and body. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1175))
- That’s what experience does; it enriches the brain. ([Location 1188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1188))
- When your attention, and therefore your energy, is divided between all these outer-world objects, people, problems, and issues, there’s no energy left for you to put on your inner world of thoughts and feelings. So there’s no energy left for you to use to create something new. ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1199))
- emotions—which are energy in motion—are the chemical residue of experience. ([Location 1245](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1245))
- If how you think and how you feel determines the frequency and information you are emitting in your energy field, which has a significant effect on your life, and if all your attention (and so all your energy) is tied up in your outer world of people, objects, things, places, and time, there is no energy left in your inner world of thoughts and feelings. Therefore, the stronger the emotion you are addicted to, the more you will place your attention on that person, object, place, or circumstance in your outer world—giving away most of your creative energy and causing you to feel and think equal to everything you know. It becomes difficult to think or feel in any new ways when you are addicted to your outer world. And it’s possible that you can become addicted to all the people and things in your life that are causing all your problems in the first place. That’s how you give your power away and mismanage your energy. ([Location 1252](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1252))
- How much of your creative energy is tied up in guilt, hatred, resentment, lack, or fear? The truth is that you could be using all that energy to re-create a new destiny. ([Location 1270](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1270))
- If you’re going to disconnect from the outer world, you have to learn how to change your brain waves. ([Location 1305](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1305))
- Most of the time that you are awake and conscious, you are in the beta range of brain-wave frequencies. ([Location 1306](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1306))
- While you may spend most of your waking time in beta-frequency brain waves, you also dip into alpha-frequency brain waves throughout your day. You display alpha brain waves when you are relaxed, calm, creative, and even intuitive—when you’re no longer thinking or analyzing and instead you’re daydreaming or imagining, like a trance state. ([Location 1315](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1315))
- Theta-frequency brain waves take over in that twilight stage when your mind is still awake but your body is drifting off to sleep. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1319))
- This frequency is also associated with deep states of meditation. ([Location 1319](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1319))
- Delta-frequency brain waves usually come during deep, restorative sleep. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1320))
- As you take your attention off your past-present reality or your predictable future reality, you are calling energy back to you and building your own electromagnetic field. Now you have available energy to heal yourself or to create a new experience in your life. ([Location 1372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1372))
- And since emotions are a record of the past and where I place my attention is where I place my energy, ([Location 1423](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1423))
- When you are in the sweet spot of the generous present moment, your familiar past and your predictable future no longer exist and now you are ready to create new possibilities in your life. ([Location 1434](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1434))
- The quantum (or unified) field is an invisible field of energy and information— ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1451))
- or you could say a field of intelligence or consciousness—that exists beyond space and time. ([Location 1451](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1451))
- experience, I believe there’s a self-organizing intelligence that is energy, and it is observing all of the universes and galaxies into order. ([Location 1455](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1455))
- think of the quantum field as being filled with infinite amounts of energy vibrating beyond the physical world of matter and beyond our senses—invisible waves of energy available for us to use in creation. ([Location 1471](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1471))
- everything in our known universe, although it may appear to be solid, is actually 99.999999999999 percent energy or information. ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1488))
- 1 In fact, most of the universe is made up of this “empty” space; matter is an infinitesimally small component in relation to the immense space of nothing physical. ([Location 1489](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1489))
- Researchers soon discovered that the electrons that move around in that vast field behave in a completely unpredictable manner—they don’t appear to be subject to the same laws that govern matter in our larger universe. They’re here in one moment and then gone the next—and it’s impossible to predict where and when the electrons will appear. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1490))
- If you focus on the unknown, you create a possibility. The longer you can linger in that field of infinite possibilities as an awareness—aware that you are aware in this endless black space—without putting your attention on your body, on things, or on people, places, and time, the longer you invest your energy into the unknown, the more you are going to create a new experience or new possibilities in your life. It’s the law. ([Location 1517](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1517))
- what syncs in the brain begins to link in the brain. Once your brain gets coherent, you get coherent. When it gets orderly, you get orderly, when it works well, you work well. ([Location 1538](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1538))
- When we take our attention off the material world and begin to open our focus to the realm of the unknown and stay in the present moment, the brain works in a coherent manner. When your brain is coherent, it is working in a more holistic state and you will feel more whole. ([Location 1543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1543))
- the autonomic nervous system—the body’s subconscious operating system ([Location 1556](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1556))
- a deeper brain-wave state of coherent synchronized theta. If in this state you are no longer reaffirming the known—your same life—and instead you keep investing your energy into the unknown (as you would invest money in a bank account), then you are able to create new, unknown possibilities in your life. ([Location 1573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1573))
- heartfelt emotions. ([Location 1609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1609))
- emotion is energy in motion, and elevated emotions carry a higher frequency than survival emotions. ([Location 1637](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1637))
- Take out a piece of paper and write the letter ‘J’ on it, and draw two squiggly lines around it to represent the electromagnetic field.” (Hang on, because you’re going to be doing something similar in the meditation at the end of this chapter.) Once he’d done that, I said, “That ‘J’ is a symbol that represents a possibility—your clear intention of the job you want. But now we have to get very clear on exactly what kind of job you want, so let’s list what’s important to you in this job. I want you to think about the conditions of what that letter ‘J’ for ‘new job’ means to you. Under that ‘J,’ I want you to write the ([Location 1701](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1701))
- word intention and list the specifics of what you want in your new job. You can write down anything you want except when or how it is going to happen.” ([Location 1706](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1706))
- “I want to be able to work from anywhere in the world,” he told me, “and I want to make the same amount of money I was making at my old job—or more. I want to have independent contracts for six months to a year, and I have to love what I do.” “Good—anything else?” I asked. “Yeah, I want to be my own boss and lead my own team,” he said. “Okay, now you have your clear intention,” I told him. “Every time you think of this letter ‘J,’ can you associate the letter with the meaning you just gave it—all the specifics of what you want that you just listed?” He said he could do that. ([Location 1707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1707))
- Then I asked him to think about how he was going to feel when it happened. “Next to or below your sub-intentions that you listed to get clear on your new job,” I told him, “I want you to write, ‘Elevated Emotions—the Energy of My Future.’ Now let’s list them one by one. What are they?” ([Location 1712](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1712))
- “Empowered, in love with life, free, and grateful,” he told me, identifying the elevated emotions he would use to bring this job to him. ([Location 1715](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1715))
- “And then, once you’ve been in that new state of being for some time, I want you to think about what you’re going to do in your new job,” I continued. “What choices will you make? What things will you do? What experiences await you and how will they feel? I want you to live in that future reality in the present moment. Simply remember your future from that new state of being.” ([Location 1730](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1730))
- Just as people tend to obsess about the worst thing that could happen to them in their lives every day, I was instead asking my son to obsess about some of the greatest things that could happen when his new job found him. “Think about all the time you will have to surf, the traveling you can continue to do, the team of people you will work with, their strengths, and the money you can save for a new house and a new car,” I encouraged him. ([Location 1732](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1732))
- “And since where you place your attention is where you place your energy,” I continued, “I want you to invest your attention and your energy into that new future. And just as your body follows your mind to the shower every morning—to a known—if you keep doing this process, your body is going to follow your mind to an unknown.” ([Location 1737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1737))
- Preparing to Tune In ([Location 1769](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1769))
- we are quite literally beings of light, each radiating a very vital life force and expressing an actual light field around our bodies— ([Location 1889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1889))
- the totality of each cell expressing and contributing to a vital field of light that carries a message. ([Location 1890](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1890))
- Convergent focus is a single-minded or narrow focus on an object—anything having matter. ([Location 1905](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1905))
- It’s the same kind of focus you use when you pay attention to objects in your environment. Typically, when you go to pick up a glass, call or text somebody, or tie your shoe, you use narrow focus. The majority of the time that you’re in narrow focus, you’re focusing on objects or things (matter) and people or places in the outer world—mostly things that have three dimensions. ([Location 1907](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1907))
- narrow, convergent focus—obsessively thinking about the same things over and over again. ([Location 1920](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1920))
- when you change your attention from using this narrow focus to adopting a more open and broad focus, as you will do in this meditation, you can become aware of the space and so the light and energy around your body in space. This is called a divergent focus. ([Location 1923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1923))
- You go from focusing on some thing to focusing on no thing—on the wave (energy) instead of the particle (matter). Reality is both the particle and the wave; it’s both matter and energy. ([Location 1924](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1924))
- this shift in attention from narrow to open focus changes brain waves. ([Location 1930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1930))
- One of the main purposes of meditation is to move beyond the analytical mind. What separates the conscious mind from the subconscious mind is the analytical mind. ([Location 1939](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1939))
- As you do the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation I will teach you later on in this chapter, you’ll place your attention in each of your body’s energy centers (also referred to as chakras—meaning wheels—in ancient East Indian Vedic texts), and then you’ll open your focus. Because where you place your attention is where you place your energy, as you place your attention in each center and your energy moves to it, each one of these individual centers begins to become activated. ([Location 1942](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1942))
- Mind is the brain in action, ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1974))
- has a plexus of neurons, then each has its own individual mind—or better said, each center has a mind of its own. What activates the mind is energy with a directive and intention, a conscious intent. ([Location 1974](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1974))
- when you lead with your heart you tend to be more caring, kind, inspired, selfless, compassionate, giving, grateful, trusting, and patient. ([Location 1996](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=1996))
- When energy becomes stuck in our body, it cannot flow to the higher centers. Since emotions are energy, these emotions get stuck in different centers and we cannot evolve. ([Location 2081](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2081))
- the proper use of the breath is one of the keys to becoming supernatural. ([Location 2265](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2265))
- your thoughts drive your feelings, and your feelings drive your thoughts, and eventually this loop hardwires your brain into the same patterns, which conditions your body into the past. And because emotions are a record of past experiences, if you can’t think greater than how you feel, this thinking-feeling loop keeps you anchored to your past and creates a constant state of being. This is how the body becomes the mind—or in time, how your thoughts run you and your feelings own you. ([Location 2273](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2273))
- So once your body becomes the mind of that emotion, your body is literally in the past. ([Location 2277](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2277))
- Now let’s look at how the thinking-feeling loop works in relation to the body’s energy centers—especially the first three, the survival centers, where it causes the most problems. That’s because most people’s thoughts and feelings activate those energy centers. ([Location 2294](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2294))
- each of the body’s energy centers has its own individual energy, information, glands, hormones, chemistry, and neurocircuitry—and its own individual mini-brain or mind (or, really, each has a mind of its own). ([Location 2296](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2296))
- Think of neuropeptides as molecules of emotion. ([Location 2308](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2308))
- Your brain monitors your chemical state, and the moment you feel angry, it’s going to think more corresponding thoughts equal to how you feel. ([Location 2314](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2314))
- If you are overly lustful, overly sexed, or overly preoccupied with wanting to be seen by others as sexually desirable, your energy is stuck in your first center. If you experience an overabundance of guilt, sadness, fear, depression, shame, unworthiness, low self-esteem, suffering, and pain, your energy will become stuck in your second center. And if you have problems with anger, aggression, frustration, control issues, judgment, or self-importance, your energy is stuck in your third center. (Hopefully by now you have done the Blessing of the Energy Centers meditation and have begun to experience how the energy in each of your centers is able to evolve from one center to the next, increasing its frequency as it moves up.) ([Location 2364](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2364))
- In time, the body becomes the mind of that emotion, and once that energy as an emotion is stored (or more accurately, once it becomes trapped) in one or more of those lower energy centers, then the body is literally in the past. This means you no longer have energy available to create a new destiny. When that happens, your body becomes more matter and less energy because as you have read, the first three centers (which are based on survival emotions) shrink the vital field of energy surrounding your body. ([Location 2370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2370))
- liberate that trapped energy that’s stored in the first three centers so it can be free to flow to the brain—from whence it came. And when you use the breath to liberate those emotions, that energy becomes available for higher purposes. You’ll have more energy to heal yourself, create a different life, manifest more wealth, or have a mystical experience, to name just a few possibilities. ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2383))
- Your sacrum, your spinal column, and your skull are the bony structures that protect the most delicate system in your body: the central nervous system, which controls and coordinates all other systems. ([Location 2425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2425))
- Inside that closed system is the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain and the spinal cord. The spinal cord is actually an extension of your brain. The skull and the spinal column protect this most delicate system. ([Location 2428](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2428))
- The central nervous system is one of your body’s most important systems because it controls and coordinates all the other systems in the body. ([Location 2430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2430))

- torus field. ([Location 2484](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2484))
- by doing this breathing technique, you’re starting to stir up all this stored energy in a very big way. And if you do this technique correctly and you do it enough times, you are going to wake up a sleeping dragon. ([Location 2488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2488))
- Before we start the formal meditation, ([Location 2622](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2622))
- When you’re ready to begin, lift up your perineum, your pelvic floor—the same muscles that you use for intercourse and elimination. Do not hold your breath as you do this—breathe normally. Squeeze those muscles as tightly as you can and hold for five seconds; then let go and relax. Do it again and hold it for the same amount of time. Do it a third time, holding it for about five seconds, and then relax again. I want you to gain conscious control over these muscles because you are going to be using them in a different way. ([Location 2625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2625))
- Since our human ancestors ([Location 2876](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2876))
- the heart has appeared as a symbol to represent health, wisdom, intuition, guidance, and higher intelligence. ([Location 2877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2877))
- beyond its obvious role in sustaining life, is not simply a muscular pump that moves blood throughout our body but an organ capable of influencing feelings and emotions. ([Location 2888](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2888))
- The heart is a sensory organ that guides our decision-making ability as well as our understanding of ourselves and our place in the world. It’s a symbol that transcends time, place, and culture. It’s a commonly accepted premise that when we are connected to the heart’s inner knowing, we can tap into its wisdom as a source of love and higher guidance. ([Location 2889](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2889))
- out of all the organs in the body (such as the spleen, liver, or kidneys), the heart is the only one to have intelligence. ([Location 2892](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2892))
- the elevated feelings of the heart connect us to the consciousness of love, compassion, gratitude, joy, unity, acceptance, and selflessness. ([Location 2894](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2894))
- Stress is one of the main contributing factors to heart disease, and it’s reaching an epidemic level. ([Location 2902](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2902))
- in order to create a new future, a person needs to marry a clear intention (coherent brain) with an elevated emotion (coherent heart). ([Location 2910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2910))
- by combining an intention or thought (which, as you have read, acts as the electrical charge) with a feeling or emotion (which you already understand acts as a magnetic charge), we can change our biological energy—and when we change our energy, we change our lives. ([Location 2911](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2911))
- Heart coherence begins with the steady, coherent drumbeat of the heart through cultivating, practicing, and sustaining elevated emotions; such emotions include gratitude, appreciation, thankfulness, inspiration, freedom, kindness, selflessness, compassion, love, and joy. The benefits of that coherent beat are felt throughout all systems of the body. Consciously or unconsciously, many of us practice feeling unhappy, angry, or fearful each day. So why not practice creating and maintaining joyful, loving, altruistic states instead? Wouldn’t that eventually create a new internal order, resulting in overall health and happiness? ([Location 2930](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2930))
- When your heart becomes coherent, your nervous system responds by increasing the brain’s energy, creativity, and intuition, which has a positive effect on virtually every organ in the body. Now the heart and the brain are working together, causing you to feel more whole, connected, and content—not only within your own body, but also with everything and everybody. When you are in a heart-centered state, the wholeness you feel consumes any feelings you may have of want and lack. From this creative state of wholeness and oneness, magic begins to happen in your life because you’re no longer creating from duality or separation—you’re no longer waiting for something outside of you to provide relief from the internal feelings of lack, emptiness, or separation. Instead, you are becoming more familiar with your new, ideal self and creating new experiences of yourself. ([Location 2940](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2940))
- If the first three centers reflect our animal nature and are based on polarity, opposites, competition, need, and lack, the fourth center begins our journey to our divine nature. It is from within this heart center that we change our mind and energy from living in selfish states to living in selfless states, and then we feel less affected by separation or duality and are more prone to make choices for the greatest good of everyone. ([Location 2948](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2948))
- When we embrace the feelings related to the heart—feelings that lead us to give, nurture, serve, care, help, forgive, love, trust, and so on—we can’t help but feel filled up, whole, and complete. I believe this to be our innate nature as human beings. ([Location 2952](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2952))
- the autonomic nervous system, the involuntary division of the nervous system, is divided into two subsystems: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. As you know, the sympathetic nervous system when switched on regulates the body’s unconscious actions and responses, such as increased breathing, elevated heart rate, excess perspiration, dilation of the pupils, and so on. Its primary function is to stimulate the fight-or-flight response when real or perceived danger is imminent. This system works to protect us in our outer environment. The parasympathetic nervous system complements the sympathetic nervous system in that it performs the exact opposite functions. Its role is to conserve energy, relax the body, and slow the high-energy functions of the sympathetic system. The parasympathetic system maintains protection in our inner environment. If you think of the ANS as an automobile, the parasympathetic system would be the brake and the sympathetic system the accelerator. ([Location 2955](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2955))
- the heart and the brain have more nerve connections to each other than any other systems in the body. ([Location 2963](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2963))
- the sympathetic and parasympathetic, are always working to maintain a state of homeostasis (relative equilibrium between all systems) within the body. ([Location 2964](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2964))
- When the body is in a state of homeostasis, we generally feel relaxed and safe within our current environment. ([Location 2965](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2965))
- If the parasympathetic nervous system functions best when we feel safe, then the sympathetic nervous system is activated mostly when we feel unsafe. ([Location 2973](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=2973))
- when we focus our attention on our heart and emotions, the heart’s beating acts as an amplifier. ([Location 3074](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3074))
- Heart attacks and heart disease, for example, occur when the body has been under stress for extended periods of time. When we intentionally choose elevated emotions, however, focusing less on disharmony and more on gratitude, our bodies respond positively and we enjoy improved health. ([Location 3093](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3093))
- To put it simply, emotions and feelings originating in the heart play an important role in the way we think, process information, feel, and understand the world and our place in it.27 Once the heart center is activated, it acts as an amplifier to jump-start the brain, enhance its activity, and create balance, order, and coherence throughout the body. ([Location 3148](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3148))
- We now know that when our students are heart centered and feel more wholeness and oneness, they’re less separate from their dreams. ([Location 3153](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3153))
- So you could repeat the affirmation I am fearless until you’re blue in the face, but if it’s fear you’re actually feeling, the thought I am fearless never makes it past the brain stem, which means you’re not signaling the body and ANS into a new, specific destiny. The feeling is what produces the emotional charge (energy) to stimulate your ANS into a different destiny. Without the feeling, a disconnect remains between your brain and body—between the thought of health and the feeling of health—and you can’t embody that new state of being. ([Location 3159](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3159))
- Heart Coherence Meditation ([Location 3237](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3237))
- the best way to program a person to take a desired action is to put them into an alpha brain-wave state so that the information presented is not analyzed. ([Location 3474](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3474))
- Mind Movies program our students’ subconscious minds the same way that television commercials program us, but in more positive, unlimited, and constructive ways. ([Location 3609](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3609))
- This is why language is stored in the left hemisphere—it’s routine. You can think about the right hemisphere as the territory of the unknown and the left hemisphere as the territory of the known. ([Location 3619](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3619))
- the right hemisphere would be romantic, creative, and nonlinear, while the left hemisphere would be methodical, logical, and structured. ([Location 3621](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3621))
- If the left hemisphere operates in the known, and the right hemisphere operates in the unknown, as activity increases in your right hemisphere, you are more open to creating something unknown and new. ([Location 3629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3629))
- Next, you add words of affirmation or knowing to the Mind Movie that remind you of who you are and what you believe about your future. ([Location 3669](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3669))
- Some examples could include: The doors of dimension open to me so I may experience the mystical. My body is healing every day. My words are law. I feel loved deeply and daily. Wealth flows to me. All my needs are always met. My body becomes younger every day. The divine appears in my life every day. My life partner is my equal and teaches me by example. Synchronicities happen to me all of the time. I feel more whole every day. My immune system gets stronger each day. I lead with courage in my life. I am an unlimited genius. I am always aware of the power within me and all around me. I believe in myself. I embrace the unknown. When I call on Spirit it responds. ([Location 3671](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3671))
- the Mind Movie technology is a great tool to help you bring your future to life by repeatedly experiencing it. It’s also a great way to gain clarity on what you want to unfold in your life—and to remind yourself on a daily basis what that future holds for you. This is called intention. ([Location 3707](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3707))

- We begin by getting heart centered, which you learned in Chapter 7, locking into those elevated emotions for several minutes and radiating that energy beyond their bodies into space. ([Location 3809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0746RN3G7&location=3809))
- Imagine that you’re waiting for a friend who is running late, and instead of feeling frustrated and bothered, you’re generating the energy of your future. When you’re sitting in traffic, instead of getting impatient and angry, practice tuning in to the energy of your future with your eyes open. Imagine that when you’re in line at the grocery store and judging a person for what they’re buying, you redirect your thoughts to feeling incredibly grateful for your new life, walking as your future self.
