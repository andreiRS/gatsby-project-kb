## Highlights
- Failing the mom test Son: “Mom, mom, I have an idea for a business — can I run it by you?” I am about to expose my ego — please don’t hurt my feelings. Mom: “Of course, dear.” You are my only son and I am ready to lie to protect you. Son: “You like your iPad, right? You use it a lot?” Mom: “Yes.” You led me to this answer, so here you go. Son: “Okay, so would you ever buy an app which was like a cookbook for your iPad?” I am optimistically asking a hypothetical question and you know what I want you to say. Mom: “Hmmm.” As if I need another cookbook at my age. Son: “And it only costs $40 — that’s cheaper than those hardcovers on your shelf.” I’m going to skip that lukewarm signal and tell you more about my great idea. Mom: “Well...” Aren’t apps supposed to cost a dollar? Son: “And you can share recipes with your friends, and there’s an iPhone app which is your shopping list. And videos of that celebrity chef you love.” Please just say “yes.” I will not leave you alone until you do. Mom: “Oh, well yes honey, that sounds amazing. And you’re right, $40 is a good deal. Will it have pictures of the recipes?” I have rationalised the price outside of a real purchase decision, made a non-committal compliment, and offered a feature request to appear engaged. Son: “Yes, definitely. Thanks mom — love you!” I have completely mis-interpreted this conversation and taken it as validation. Mom: “Won’t you have some lasagna?” I am concerned that you won’t be able to afford food soon. Please eat something.

- The measure of usefulness of an early customer conversation is whether it gives us concrete facts about our customers’ lives and world views. ([Location 128](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=128))
- If you just avoid mentioning your idea, you automatically start asking better questions. Doing this is the easiest (and biggest) improvement you can make to your customer conversations. Here are 3 simple rules to help you. They are collectively called (drumroll) The Mom Test: The Mom Test: Talk about their life instead of your idea Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future Talk less and listen more ([Location 144](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=144))
- "Do you think it's a good idea?" Awful question! Here’s the thing: only the market can tell if your idea is good. Everything else is just opinion. ([Location 162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=162))
- Ask how they currently solve X and how much it costs them to do so. And how much time it takes. ([Location 172](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=172))
- Rule of thumb: If they haven't looked for ways of solving it already, they're not going to look for (or buy) yours. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=224))
- It boils down to this: you aren’t allowed to tell them what their problem is, and in return, they aren’t allowed to tell you what to build. They own the problem, you own the solution. ([Location 262](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=262))
- With the exception of industry experts who have built very similar businesses, opinions are worthless. You want facts and commitments, not compliments. ([Location 279](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=279))
- Rule of thumb: Compliments are the fool’s gold of customer learning: shiny, distracting, and worthless. ([Location 338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=338))
- While using generics, people describe themselves as who they want to be, not who they actually are. You need to get specific to bring out the edge cases. ([Location 375](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=375))
- Startups are about focusing and executing on a single, scalable idea rather than jumping on every good one which crosses your desk. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=419))
- Questions to dig into feature requests: “Why do you want that?” “What would that let you do?” “How are you coping without it?” “Do you think we should push back the launch to add that feature, or is it something we could add later?” “How would that fit into your day?” ([Location 464](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=464))
- Questions to dig into emotional signals: “Tell me more about that.” “That seems to really bug you — I bet there’s a story here.” “What makes it so awful?” “Why haven’t you been able to fix this already?” “You seem pretty excited about that — it’s a big deal?” “Why so happy?” “Go on.” ([Location 467](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=467))
- Rule of thumb: The more you’re talking, the worse you’re doing. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=516))
- You can tell it’s an important question when its answer could completely change (or disprove) your business. If you get an unexpected answer to a question and it doesn’t affect what you’re doing, it wasn’t a terribly important question to begin with. ([Location 524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=524))
- Every time you talk to someone, you should be asking at least one question which has the potential to destroy your currently imagined business. ([Location 526](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=526))
- Rule of thumb: You should be terrified of at least one of the questions you’re asking in every conversation. ([Location 534](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=534))
- “Does-this-problem-matter” questions: “How seriously do you take your blog?” “Do you make money from it?” “Have you tried making more money from it?” “How much time do you spend on it each week?” “Do you have any major aspirations for your blog?” “Which tools and services do you use for it?” “What are you already doing to improve this?” “What are the 3 big things you’re trying to fix or improve right now?” ([Location 662](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=662))
- Video games are pure product risk. What sort of question could you ask to validate your game idea? “Do you like having fun? Would you like to have even more fun?” Practically 100% of the risk is in the product and almost none is in the customer. You know people buy games. If yours is good and you can find a way to make them notice it, they’ll buy it. You don’t need to rediscover people’s desire to play video games. ([Location 724](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=724))
- Rule of thumb: Learning about a customer and their problems works better as a quick and casual chat than a long, formal meeting. ([Location 771](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=771))
- The real failure is listed above as #2: not even asking. I never consider rejection to be a real failure. But not asking certainly is. This can happen because you’re avoiding the scary question or because you haven’t figured out what the next steps should be. ([Location 865](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=865))
- The framing format I like has five key elements. You’re an entrepreneur trying to solve horrible problem X, usher in wonderful vision Y, or fix stagnant industry Z. Don’t mention your idea. Frame expectations by mentioning what stage you’re at and, if it’s true, that you don’t have anything to sell. Show weakness and give them a chance to help by mentioning the specific problem that you’re looking for answers on. This will also clarify that you’re not a time waster. Put them on a pedestal by showing how much they, in particular, can help. Explicitly ask for help. ([Location 1101](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1101))
- Hey Pete, I'm trying to make desk & office rental less of a pain for new businesses (vision). We’re just starting out and don’t have anything to sell, but want to make sure we’re building something that actually helps (framing). I’ve only ever come at it from the tenant’s side and I’m having a hard time understanding how it all works from the landlord’s perspective (weakness). You’ve been renting out desks for a while and could really help me cut through the fog (pedestal). Do you have time in the next couple weeks to meet up for a chat? (ask) ([Location 1109](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B01H4G2J1U&location=1109))
